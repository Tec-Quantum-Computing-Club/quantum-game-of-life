# Quantum Game of Life

This project consists of a Quantum Cellular Automata based heavily on Jhon Conway's Game of Life, the process consists on a variable sized grid where each pixel represents a cell that can be either dead or alive, the process of dying and coming to life depends on the neighboring cells, so each snapshot is based on the last one following this set of rules.

- 1 or 2 neighbors    ->  A living cell dies off
- 3 neighbors         ->  A death cell comes to life
- 4 or more neighbors ->  A living cell dies off
